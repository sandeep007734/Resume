 \normalsize{\textsc{Control Flow Integrity: Secure Execution}} \\
\footnotesize{We are looking at ways to ensure that the control flow integrity of a binary is preserved. Variety of attacks can be mounted on a binary. We are looking into solutions that prevents majority of attacks and whether software based solutions will be enough or do we need to make some changes to the hardware.
