\item
\textsc{Analyzing applications performance in a TEE setting}\\
\footnotesize{The impact of running an application in a TEE setting, especially in Intel SGX, has not been studied in-depth. Through this project, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the working of Intel SGX  and open previosly unknown avenues for peformance optimization and security improvement.}

%\item 
%\normalsize{\textsc{Optimizing performance of applications in NVMM}}\\
%\footnotesize{Modern servers are adopting the large size but high-latency persistent memory of NVMM to accommodate applications with large memory footprint. However, the performance suffers as the operating system does not take into account the different characteristics of the DRAM and the NV-MM. We are working on improving the performance of such application via the kernel support.}

%\item 
%\normalsize{\textsc{A Secure File System for Intel SGX}} \\
%\footnotesize{In this project, we are exploring an efficient and secure file system support for applications running in a secure enclave provided by Intel SGX, which does not support system calls and consequently, the file system in its current form.}

\item 
\normalsize{\textsc{Hardware assisted Control Flow Integrity}} \\
\footnotesize{We are looking at ways to ensure the control flow integrity of a binary. Several attacks are mounted on the execution of a binary, which violates confidentiality or integrity or both. A trusted execution environment, which guarantees a secure execution environment, has severe limitations in its current form. We are exploring ways to alleviate these problems.
