\textsc{Human GAIT Analysis.} \\
\footnotesize{Human GAIT Analysis is the study of Human Motion and is used to figure out the problem in people with abnormal Gait and if possible fix it. The current gold standard method of doing a Gait Analysis is by using Optical system, which are very expensive and not so easy to use. We are looking into ways to use \textbf{IMU(Inertial Measurement Unit)} sensors, which comes with inbuilt Gyroscope, Accelerometer and Magnetometer, to perform Gait Analysis . We are currently looking at algorithms and methods which can make the results from IMU system clinically relevant. We can use Machine Learning techniques to provided suggestion to Doctors and Surgeons based on the data recorded.
