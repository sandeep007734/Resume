\item 
\normalsize{\textsc{SecureFS: A Secure File System for Intel SGX}} \\
\footnotesize{In this project, we are exploring an efficient and secure file system support for applications running in a secure enclave provided by Intel SGX, which does not support system calls and consequently, the file system in its current form.}

%\item 
%\normalsize{\textsc{Survey of Hardware assisted defense methods for CFI.}} \\
%\footnotesize{We are working on a through analysis of hardware assisted defense methods to maintain control flow integrity of a binary's execution.}

\item 
\normalsize{\textsc{Security aspects of a Remote Operations System or ROS}} \\
\footnotesize{ROS is widely used in autonomous vehicles. In this project, we are exploring the current security challenges for a ROS based system and propose an efficient solution for it.}

\item 
\normalsize{\textsc{Hardware assisted Control Flow Integrity}} \\
\footnotesize{We are looking at ways to ensure the control flow integrity of a binary. Several attacks are mounted on the execution of a binary, which violates confidentiality or integrity or both. A trusted execution environment, which guarantees a secure execution environment, has severe limitations in its current form. We are exploring ways to alleviate these problems.
